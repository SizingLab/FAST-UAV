    "Welcome to FAST-UAV, a framework for the multidisciplinary design of electric UAVs.<br>\n",
    "FAST-UAV is based on the open source library [FAST-OAD](https://fast-oad.readthedocs.io), which provides numerical capabilities for aircraft design. The computational core of FAST-OAD is itself based on the [OpenMDAO framework](https://openmdao.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to introduce the basic usage of FAST-UAV. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:\n",
    "1. Set up a UAV design problem in FAST-UAV\n",
    "2. Run an optimization to obtain the best feasible design for a given set of specifications\n",
    "3. Visualize the results\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the way FAST-UAV work is very similar to FAST-OAD. Don't hesitate to have a look at the [FAST-OAD documentation](https://fast-oad.readthedocs.io) to learn more about the basics."

    "### a) Folders and files\n",
    "\n",
    "To organize our work, we will use two different folders, namely `data/` and `workdir/`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `data/` folder stores the configuration files, the mission files and the source (reference) files. The `workdir/` folder stores temporary files, for instance copies of the problem inputs and outputs. Let explain in more details the different files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A `configuration.yaml` file is a minimalistic interface where you can define the design problem, including the UAV concept (multirotor, fixed wing, or hybrid) to be optimized or evaluated, the optimization variables/constraints/objectives, and the optimization algorithm settings. Default configuration files are provided by FAST-UAV for the main UAV concepts and design problems, which you can find in the `data/configurations` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The design problem definition requires a `missions.yaml` file. This file allows you to define the mission profile, e.g. if you have a climb phase followed by a cruise and a hover. This definition is purely qualitative here. The values associated to each of the flight segments (e.g. climb rate and hover duration) are provided in the `problem_inputs.xml` file described hereafter.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The input file `problem_inputs.xml` allows you to specify the values for the design specifications (e.g. mission requirements and number of propellers) and, for advanced users, to access and fine-tune the model parameters. In practice, a small interface is provided (see further below in this notebook) to access and modify the input file rather than having to open/modify the raw XML file. As a starting point, FAST-UAV provides some examples of input files, which can be found in the `data/source_files` directory."
