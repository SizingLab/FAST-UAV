<b>FAST-UAV</b> is a Python tool dedicated to optimal drone design with a multi-disciplinary approach.

Based on the [FAST-OAD](https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD) and [OpenMDAO](https://openmdao.org/) frameworks, it allows to easily switch between models to address different types of configurations. 

Currently, FAST-UAV is bundled with analytical models for multi-rotor, fixed-wing and quad-plane (hybrid VTOL) UAVs.

üöÄ Quick start
-------

FAST-UAV requires a version of Python higher than 3.8. The installation can be done using the `pip` command:

```{.bash}
pip install fastuav
```

Now that FAST-UAV is installed, you can start using it through [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/):
```{.bash}
jupyter lab
```
Jupyter lab will open automatically in your browser. Then, navigate to the `src/fastuav/notebooks` directory and start with the first tutorial notebook.

**Note**: It is recommended to install FAST-UAV in a virtual environment ([conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)...)
