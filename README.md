# FAST-UAV

FAST-UAV is a solution to perform optimal drone design with a multi-disciplinary approach.

Based on the [FAST-OAD](https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD) framework, it allows to easily switch between models to address different types of configurations. 

Currently, FAST-UAV is bundled with analytical models, scaling laws and datasheet regressions for modeling multirotor drones.
