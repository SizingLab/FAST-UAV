FAST-UAV
========

FAST-UAV is a solution to perform optimal drone design with a multi-disciplinary approach.

Based on the [FAST-OAD](https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD) framework, it allows to easily switch between models to address different types of configurations. 

Currently, FAST-UAV is bundled with analytical models for multirotor and fixed wing drones.

Install
-------
It is recommended to install FAST-UAV in a virtual environment, using poetry.

> ``` {.bash}
> $ conda create -n fastuav python=3.8
> $ conda activate fastuav
> $ conda install poetry
> $ poetry install
> ```

Run
-------
> ``` {.bash}
> $ jupyter lab
> ```
